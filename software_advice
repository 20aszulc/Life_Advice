how to write faster software:
be in flow state. domt get up and do random shit
memorize shortcut keys
time blocking
scripting to automate repetive tasks. esp testing
build out a diagram or blue print of what u intend to code b4 u code
log as u go. not print statements. log stayements. prwferably which thread it is involved in
spend long times in a focused session
Writing small scripts to automate boring or repetitive workflows

Interesting one: do not use the debugger (for the most part) except for call stacks. Prefer print and logging statements. Assert statements are your friends
The biggest bottlenecks to your code: implementing the wrong plan, debugging when its a small error, trying to test while making small changes. Testing SLOWS u down
Seperate timeblocks for testing and debugging. Sometimes that "almost there" feeling is not actually true and u arent almost there
KEEP IT SIMPLE STUPID. Writing the least amount of code w the cleanest, simplest solution is best. This will be hard but for other than meetings or learning for note taking
-> try to type everything that comes across your mind or you think needs to be accomplished
