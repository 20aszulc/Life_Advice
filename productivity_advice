omg i spent the entire day still doing low value activities.

how to get myself to stop browsing reddit??

i figured out how to read articles faster with tldr site.
also docsbot.ai IS AMAZING for summarizing youtube videos. imma do that from here on out 

low value activities:
- scrolling social media and time spent on your phone
- 
- talking about whats on ur mind
- shopping. ur goal should be to never enter a store again.
- driving anywhere not work or home.
- decision fatigue over what to eat. Eating carbs when meat is soooo much faster


 Plan ur meals and do delivery going forward. impulse buys are exception -> i think i can plan my impulse purchases. get lots of highly fatty food and prepurchase chocolare


Plans to reduce low value activities:
- dont buy anything unless its delivered/ pickup
- stop allowing your phone to control ur life. block it. then create a cage for it so you dont use it. esp reddit and youtube
- wearing synthetic materials. cotton and bamboo only
- prevent urself from having access to the phone
- youtube transcripts for videos
- too much context switiching: keep a pomorod timer. keep a list of articles u research and a time scheduled for rwading them.
- dont go to the bathroom even if u have the urge. wait until it is coming out b4 u go. go to the toilet at 12pm everyday
- stop getting ur shopping/ups done around noon. its not efficient and is quite a waste
- get ur ups pick ups ON FRIDAYS AT 5PM. get gas on the way back.
- get ur chit chatting and context switching undercontrol. dont go up and get hot teas (im not cold anymore. just keep a giant water next to you.)
- stop getting wmotional in ur speech or bringing ur issues/thoughts into conversation. dude this is fucking harddddd to do.
- do not initiate a conversation at the start of the day. dont transition conversation. 
- what do i do if i get ansy and want to stop being in the zone? Recognize u are losong focus and context switching. mutter that u are losing focus and need to get bakc in the zone for the rest of ur pomorodo timer. what if i have lower back pain? pomorodo timer then idk. pomorodo timer for candy addiction
- preplanning meals. 
- trying to get ur eating and sleeping and shitting on regular intervals. stop eating between 6pm and 7am. Shit at noon and between 5 to 7pm.
- pretend or lay down by 9pm or 10pm or if that doesnt work 1am
- if u need to sh*t just go to the bathrooms outside and take ur enema. Just speeds things up a lotttttt. ALL TIME U ABOUT TO SH*T, take an enema first
- also NOT TAKING CASTOR OIL. Also not being low fodmap. Only way to speed up the bowels.
- ASSEMBELING furniture. You dont need a bed. 
- not using an ai agent to do your emails and rental tours
     Get a chair (this comfy one, a desk and thats it.) 
     CHAIR SHOULD NOT REQUIRE ASSEMBLY nor fold out.
     Make it a small desk thats like a fold out and a chair that doent need to be raised

every sunday:
laundry and weekly planning.
meal planning and ensuring delivery

Every OTHER sat/Sunday routine:
preplan what ur meal options could be and segment into portions sizes into plastic bags. make mixed veggie and nut bags.
purchase meals for delivery
Cook all meals and put things in freezer
Take out garbage. only make enough garbage to last 2 weeks. stop accepting reciepts + delivery only.

Things that impede your performance and managing impulses:
Impulses I want stopped
switching tasks all the time while working
checking phone, calling someone when I have an idea
blurting out things about me in a conversation. Stop OVERSHARING
Its sooo weird I have the constant impulse to get up and go to walmart.
Feeling the need to watch something on youtube -> THIS ONE IS TERRIBLE!!!
impulse to shop esp getting sweets although that is going away
impulse to shop for food instead of using the food I have at home. That one is confusing
I dont prioritize or time-block.
I want to get up and do something else all the time. And task switching. Getting out of focus mode.


Health issues u have to accomodate for with olans as to how:
inability to sleep -> naps during work, weekends lots of sleeo
negative thoughts -> it doesnt matter what its about: weight, looks, conversation, singlehood. these are some form of inflammation to the brain likely caused by outside sugar or food. i dont know how to stop these thoughts but DONT LET THESE THOUGHTS BCM U. You dont have to just be a ball of saddness. you can accomplish anything. recognize these intrusive thoughts and 
inability to shi -> enemas, bring water jug, bring coffee? 
sweet cravings -< anti candids oills_


Your time is sooooooo limited. You need to prioritize high value tasks that enhance your life
- excercise, socializing but witty, fixing things, ai and dsp, talking elequently. dancing
- all other things in life are a WASTE. its hard to noitce bc they creep up on you
    but modern day anything you do in the digital sphere need to be automated or expedited in some way. 
       this means utube videos should be read
        reddit is only looked at thru ai
       get an ai bot to do ur shopping, contacting, and enailing (must be done on a computer)
        businesses try to STEAL YOUR TIME because u are the PRODUCT or the consumer. your time is valuable its $40 an hour. each minute u waste is like $.66 being wasted. dont waste it!!!! Stop wasting time on reddit or anything out of the way or low value, tedious activities. automate automate automate when possible! also buy a better laptop!
